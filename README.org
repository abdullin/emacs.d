This is my configuration for Emacs described in =org-mode=.

I went through a bunch of IDEs and editors in my life, Emacs was the
first one that deserved setting up such a configuration project :)

* References

These configs are stiched together from a bunch of sources and smart
people:

+ dotfiles by [[https://github.com/howardabrams/dot-files][Howard Abrams]];
+ Emacs wiki;
+ Good guide on setting up Emacs [[http://emacsformacosx.com/tips][in OSX]].

* Setting up Emacs

Install cask, if needed:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew tap caskroom/cask
  brew install brew-cask
#+END_SRC

Install dependencies:


#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew cask install xquartz
#+END_SRC

Install Emacs (latest dev version):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # install emacs by compiling
  brew install emacs --HEAD --use-git-head --with-cocoa \\
              --with-gnutls --srgb --with-librsvg --with-ns
  # Link emacs to the apps
  brew linkapps emacs
#+END_SRC

Setup Emacs to work as a server:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # setup emacs to launch as a daemon on startup
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/emacs/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  # launch emacs server right away
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.emacs.plist
#+END_SRC

Now we can launch emacs window very fast:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacsclient -c
#+END_SRC

or, you could setup an alias in =.zshrc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
alias ec='emacsclient -c'
#+END_SRC
