If you see weird symbols in terminal inside emacs


You don't have eterm-color terminfo. First, you try to add following S-exp in your configuration file and evaluate.

;; Use Emacs terminfo, not system terminfo
(setq system-uses-terminfo nil)
If problem is not resolved previous setting, you should create eterm-color terminfo by using following command. (terminfo path may different from your system)

# If you use Cocoa Emacs or Carbon Emacs
tic -o ~/.terminfo /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/etc/e/eterm-color.ti
